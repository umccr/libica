# **abort_analysis**
> abort_analysis(project_id, analysis_id)

Abort an analysis.

Endpoint for aborting an analysis. The status of the analysis is not updated immediately, only when the abortion of the analysis has actually started.This is a non-RESTful endpoint, as the path of this endpoint is not representing a REST resource.

# Changelog
For this endpoint multiple versions exist. Note that the values for request headers 'Content-Type' and 'Accept' must contain a matching version.

## [V3]
 * Initial version
## [V4]
 * Field type 'status' changed from enum to String. New statuses have been added: ['QUEUED', 'INITIALIZING', 'PREPARING_INPUTS', 'GENERATING_OUTPUTS', 'ABORTING'].
 * Field analysisPriority changed from enum to String.
 * The owner and tenant are now represented by Identifier objects.

If the header is supplied for a successful response (HTTP status code &lt; 400) then the response  will be saved for 7 days for the specific API endpoint, header value and user reference. When the same user makes  a new request within 7 days to the same API endpoint with the same Idempotency-Key header value, following use cases can occur:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the request body is the same as the previous request and an answer is stored &#x3D;&gt; the stored response is returned without executing the request again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the request body is the same as the previous request and no answer is stored because the previous request has not finished &#x3D;&gt; 409 error response, which indicates that the original call is still in progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the request body is not the same as the previous request &#x3D;&gt; 422 error response, as this is not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This means that each time when executing a new API request using the Idempotency-Key header, the request has to contain a new header value that hasn&#39;t been used (successfully) in the past 7 days for that specific API endpoint and by the specific user. For error responses (HTTP status code &gt;&#x3D; 400) we allow clients to retry the call. This is where we don&#39;t follow the IETF specification. | [optional]
