# JobStatus

This enum was originally created to store the type of job on a folder or file entity.   The Job entity is now used to track this information for copy operations, with the Illumina.Gds.Api.Models.Enums.JobOperationType   and Illumina.Gds.Api.Models.Enums.JobProgressStatus used to record the type and progress status of the job.
